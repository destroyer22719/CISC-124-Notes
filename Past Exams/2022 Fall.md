# Q1
## A
`1, 2`
and
`99.0, 43.0`

```java
public class Point2 {

private double x;

private static double y;

  

public Point2(double xVal, double yVal) {

x = xVal;

y = yVal;

}

  

public void results() {

System.out.println(this.x);

System.out.println(this.y);

  

}

  

public static void main(String[] args) {

Point2 p = new Point2(1.0, 2.0);

p.results();

Point2 q = new Point2(99.0, 43.0);

q.results();

}

}
```
## B
```java
public Point2() {
	this(1, 1);
}
```
## C
A condition that must hold true for the object's life span
## D
The reflective property states that an object must equal itself. It can be implemented by `this == obj`
## E
`hashCode` generates a hashcode, which is used to quickly checked for equalities, and are used in `HashSet` and `HashMap`
## F
Aggregation is one way whereas depedence is two way
## G?
bitch
## H
C?
## I
iterable
## J
To define methods and fields that a class must implement and it must implement all of it
## K
