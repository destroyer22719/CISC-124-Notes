# Q1
## A
What is the main difference between a static and non-static field?

a non static method can only be invoked on the instance of the class. Non-static methods don't require an instance of the class being created and can be accessed just be using the class's name, such as `Math.max()`

## B
the `this` keyword refer to the instance of the class it is being called on.

## C(?)
What is the definition of the term precondition as it applies to methods?

A pre-condition is a condition that must be held in order for the method to be invoked properly

## D
Under what condition can two or more methods have the same name in a class?

Method overloading, in which methods can share the same name only if they accept different arguements

## E ?
The `Object` class and anything else

## F ?
That we can replace any instance of the ancestor class with its subclass since the subclass has all the methods and fields of the ancestor class

## H ?
So long as the `Counter` class has a constructor that takes in no parameters and `Counter` is a subclass of  `ShoppingCounter`

## H (again? there's a typo)
The `super` keyword is used to access the constructor and any fields and methods of the parent

## I
We won't be able to traverse the linked list backwards

## J
Yes, the conditions in the for loop are valid for it to iterate every element in the list `t` because it starts at 0 and ends right before the length of the list
