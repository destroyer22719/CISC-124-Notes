# Fall Exam 2021

# Q1
## A
What is the main difference between a static and non-static field?

a non static method can only be invoked on the instance of the class. Non-static methods don't require an instance of the class being created and can be accessed just be using the class's name, such as `Math.max()`

## B
the `this` keyword refer to the instance of the class it is being called on.

## C(?)
What is the definition of the term precondition as it applies to methods?

A pre-condition is a condition that must be held in order for the method to be invoked properly

## D
Under what condition can two or more methods have the same name in a class?

Method overloading, in which methods can share the same name only if they accept different arguements

## E ?
The `Object` class and anything else

## F ?
That we can replace any instance of the ancestor class with its subclass since the subclass has all the methods and fields of the ancestor class

## H ?
So long as the `Counter` class has a constructor that takes in no parameters and `Counter` is a subclass of  `ShoppingCounter`

## H (again? there's a typo)
The `super` keyword is used to access the constructor and any fields and methods of the parent

## I
We won't be able to traverse the linked list backwards

## J
Yes, the conditions in the for loop are valid for it to iterate every element in the list `t` because it starts at 0 and ends right before the length of the list

# Q2

## A
```java
@override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
	if (obj == null) return false;
	else if (!(obj instanceof Range)) {
		return false;
	}
	Range otherRange = (Range) obj;
	
	return( Double.doubleToLongBits(this.min) == Double.doubleToLongBits(otherRange.getMin())) && (Double.toLongBits(this.max) == Double.toLongBits(otherRange.getMax()));
	
}
```
## B
```java
/**
Compare the range class with another instance of the range class

@params
Range other - another instance of Range to compare to

@returns
0 - if the distance between the min and max are the same
1 - if the distance between the min and max are greater than the object being compared to
- 1 - if the distance between the min and max are smaller than the object being compared to 
*/
public int compareTo(Range other) {
	double thisRange = this.max - this.min;
	double otherRange = other.getMax() - other.getMin();
	if ((thisRange) == (otherRange)) {
		return 0;
	} else if (thisRange > otherRange) {
		return 1
	} else {
		return -1
	}
}
```
## C
The `compareTo` method only checks if the range is equal, whereas `equals` checks if the min and max are the same if they are of the same class

## D
```java
public static Range disjointRange(Range a, Range b) {
	Range newRange;
	if (a.getMin() > b.getMax()) {
		newRange = new Range(b.getMax(), a.getMin());
	} else {
		newRange = new Range(a.getMax(), b.getMax());
	}
	return newRange;
}
```

# Q3
```java
public class PiggyBank {
	int nickels;
	int dimes;
	int quarters;

	PiggyBank () {
		this.nickels = this.dimes = this.quarters = 0;
	}

	PiggyBank(int nickels, int dimes, int quarters) {
		if (nickels < 0 || dimes < 0 || quarters < 0) {
			throw new IllegalArguementError("Can't have negative amounts of coins")
		}
		this.nickels = nickels
		this.dimes = dimes;
		this.quarters = quarters;
	}

	public int totalValue() {
		return this.nickels * 5 + this.dimes * 10 + this.quarters * 25;
	}

	public void withDraw(int cents) {
		if (cents % 5 != 0 || cents > totalValue()) {
			throw new IllegalArguementError("Invalid withdrawal amount")
		}

		int qToRemove = (int) cents / 25;
		int dToRemove = (int) (cents - 25*qtoRemove) / 10;
		int nToRemove = (int) (cents - 25*qToRemove - 10*qToRemove) / 5;

		if (cents - 25*qToRemove - 10*qToRemove - 5*nToRemove > 0) {
			throw new IllegalArguementerror("Invalid coins for withdrawal");
		}

		nickels -= nToRemove;
		dimes -= dToRemove;
		quarters -= qToRemove;
	}

	@override
	equals(Obj other) {
		if !((other isintanceof PiggyBank)) {
			return false;
		}
		PiggyBank otherBank = (PiggyBank) other;
		
		return this.nickels == otherBank.nickels && this.dimes == otherBank.dimes && this.quarters == otherBank.quarters;		
	}

	@override
	public int hashCode() {
		return Object.hash(this.nickels, this.dimes, this.quarters);
	}

	@override
	public toString toString() {
		return "Nickels: " + this.nickels + ", Dimes: " + this.dimes + "  ,Quarters: " + this.quarters;
	}
}
```

# Q4
## A
fuck them
## B ?
The first is true because the values are the same. But the second one will be false because they have the same pointers since there is no privacy leak.

## C
The first the output will print true because the value of the `.first()` is the same. But the second one will be false because they don't have the same pointer to the `Card` class since there is no privacy leak.

## D?
Assuming we  can't change the current methods shown then no, since there are no other methods used

# Q5
## A
The declared type is `Shape` but the actual type is `LineSegment`

## B
Since the declared type is `Shape`, it must only use the fields and methods of the `Shape` class, but `getLength` is a method of the `LineSegment` class
